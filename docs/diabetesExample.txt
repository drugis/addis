Fakhoury et al., 2010 review
----------------------------

PMID 20616619

Problems with the review

 - Data incorrectly reported (Zinman 2007 - HbA1c swapped)
 - Definition of "number of hypoglycemic episodes" is unclear and possible inconsistent. Plus the data are not (always) reported per arm.
 - Most studies have multiple arms with different dosages of the same drug. It is not clear how this was handled in the meta-analysis.
 - There are no forest plots.

Problems with the dataset

 - Dosages are not consistently represented, some are still to be converted to the most exact definition (e.g. twice daily etc.)
 - Endpoint directions are not always consistent
 - Variable descriptions are missing


Bydureon (Exenatide QW) EPAR
----------------------------

 - Possible alternative to full diabetes set, but dose is not as much of an issue.
