<h1>ADDIS - Aggregate Data Drug Information System</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.drugis.org/addis">ADDIS</a> is a software developed within the Dutch <a href="http://www.tipharma.com/projects/efficiency-analysis-drug-discovery-process/the-escher-project.html">Escher-project</a>
for managing and analyzing clinical trial information.</p>

<p>ADDIS comes with two built-in examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An anti-depressants example modeled on the paper: <a href="http://pubmed.com/16172440">Hansen et
al., Annals of internal medicine, 143(6): 415-426, 2005</a>. All data
was extracted by us from the original papers.</p></li>
<li><p>A hypertension example based on the EMA EPAR evaluating Edarbi. The
data were imported from ClinicalTrials.gov, with manual corrections
where needed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>ADDIS is made in <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">Java</a>, and requires Java 6 (JRE 1.6) or newer. Most
modern operating systems ship with a suitable JRE.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>1.16.4: JSON export of benefit-risk models; bugfixes.</p>

<p>1.16.3: Bugfix release.</p>

<p>1.16.2: Bugfix release.</p>

<p>1.16.1: Updated to GeMTC 0.14.1 for bugfixes and minor improvements.</p>

<p>1.16: Drug treatments can now be stratified by dose and dosing type with
   the new 'treatment' functionality. Dose stratifications can be used
   in network meta-analyses and pairwise meta-analyses. Added
   hypertension example data set. Allow importing of results from
   clinicaltrials.gov (experimental). Fixed bugs which could lead to
   data loss.</p>

<p>1.14.1: Bugfix release. </p>

<p>1.14: Network meta-analysis results can now be saved in the ADDIS data
   file. In addition, the computations can be reset and there is a new
   visual progress indicator.</p>

<p>1.12.5: Bugfix release.</p>

<p>1.12.4: The network meta-analysis simulation can be continued if it has
   not converged yet, and there is a new GUI for checking convergence.
   The benefit-risk analysis now uses the full covariance information
   from network meta-analysis. Reduced download from 30MB to 15MB.
   Bugfixes.</p>

<p>1.12.3: Bugfix release.</p>

<p>1.12.2: Bugfix release.</p>

<p>1.12.1: Input name of analyses in the first step of the wizard, not in
  a pop-up dialog at the very end.</p>

<p>1.12: Add <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/clpt.2010.291">BRAT table</a> and its value tree to benefit-risk view,
   allow selection of baseline in benefit-risk analysis, enable BRAT
   description of benefit-risk analysis, improve performance of network
   meta-analysis wizard, clarify error dialog with bug reporting
   instructions, fix many bugs.</p>

<p>1.10.1: Bugfix release</p>

<p>1.10: Enable combination treatment. Add "free text" ('Other') activity.
   Allow multiple moments of measurement for each outcome. Add installer
   and double-click loading of .addis data files on Windows.</p>

<p>1.8: Input study design (time structure), allow missing measurements,
   generate summary of efficacy table according to EMA D80 template,
   support of primary/secondary endpoints.</p>

<p>1.6.2: Bugfix release</p>

<p>1.6.1: Performance improvements for network meta-analysis, rank
   probability table.</p>

<p>1.6: User interface improvements, risk-based sampling in MetaBR, new
   schema-based XML format, added note taking in study wizard.</p>

<p>1.4: Lynd &amp; O'Brien benefit-risk analysis, corrected meta-analysis,
   network meta-analysis enhancements (assessment of convergence,
   variance parameters, node-splitting analysis, R-dump of results,
   memory management), tabbed views.</p>

<p>1.2.1: Bugfix release</p>

<p>1.2: Benefit-risk models based on a single study.</p>

<p>1.0: Welcome screen, limited editing, links to various information
   systems (PubMed, medicines.org.uk, whocc.no) and many minor
   improvements.</p>

<p>0.10: Benefit-risk analysis, baseline effect (heuristic) estimation</p>

<p>0.8.1: Faster network meta-analysis (updated library), minor fixes</p>

<p>0.8: Network meta-analysis, XML import/export</p>

<p>0.6: Added add-study-wizard, import from ClinicalTrials.gov</p>

<p>0.4.1: Fixed example data (studies Org 022 and 023), changed domain
   to be version-specific.</p>

<p>0.4: Added meta-analysis, removed combined studies and MCDA-hookup.
   Lots of minor changes.</p>

<p>0.2: Initial release.</p>

<h2>Building ADDIS from source</h2>

<p>All releases as well as a nightly build (see <a href="http://www.drugis.org/">the DrugIS website</a>)
are distributed in a compiled format. However, we also provide source
for external development / verification. The sources can be checked out
of the <a href="https://github.com/gertvv/addis">ADDIS Git repository</a>.</p>

<p>In order to compile ADDIS, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java >= 1.6</li>
<li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven 2</a></li>
<li>Other dependencies should be downloaded automatically by Maven2</li>
</ul>

<p>Building is automatic with "mvn package".</p>

<h2>Developing ADDIS using Eclipse</h2>

<p>First, let Maven configure your workspace for use with Maven:</p>

<pre><code>$ mvn eclipse:configure-workspace -Declipse.workspace=WORKSPACE_DIR
</code></pre>

<p>Use Maven to generate the eclipse project:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd SOURCE_DIR
$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
</code></pre>

<p>Then import the project into Eclipse (File -> Import -> Existing projects).</p>
