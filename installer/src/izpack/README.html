<h1>ADDIS - Aggregate Data Drug Information System</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.drugis.org/addis">ADDIS</a> is a software developed within the Dutch <a href="http://www.tipharma.com/projects/efficiency-analysis-drug-discovery-process/the-escher-project.html">Escher-project</a>
for managing and analyzing clinical trial information.</p>

<p>ADDIS comes with a built-in example modeled on the paper: <a href="http://pubmed.com/16172440">Hansen et
al., Annals of internal medicine, 143(6): 415-426, 2005</a>. All data
was extracted by us from the original papers.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>ADDIS is made in <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava/">Java</a>, and requires Java 6 (JRE 1.6) or newer. Most
modern operating systems ship with a suitable JRE.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

   Allow multiple moments of measurement for each outcome. Add installer
   and double-click loading of .addis data files on Windows.</p>

<p>1.8: Input study design (time structure), allow missing measurements,
   generate summary of efficacy table according to EMA D80 template,
   support of primary/secondary endpoints.</p>

   network meta-analysis enhancements (assessment of convergence,
   variance parameters, node-splitting analysis, R-dump of results,
   memory management), tabbed views.</p>

<p>1.2.1: Bugfix release</p>

<p>1.2: Benefit-risk models based on a single study.</p>

   systems (PubMed, medicines.org.uk, whocc.no) and many minor
   improvements.</p>

<p>0.4.1: Fixed example data (studies Org 022 and 023), changed domain
   to be version-specific.</p>

<p>0.4: Added meta-analysis, removed combined studies and MCDA-hookup.
   Lots of minor changes.</p>

<h2>Building ADDIS from source</h2>

<p>All releases as well as a nightly build (see <a href="http://www.drugis.org/">the DrugIS website</a>)
are distributed in a compiled format. However, we also provide source
for external development / verification. The sources can be checked out
of the <a href="https://github.com/gertvv/addis">ADDIS Git repository</a>.</p>

<p>In order to compile ADDIS, you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java >= 1.6</li>
<li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">Maven 2</a></li>
<li>Other dependencies should be downloaded automatically by Maven2</li>
</ul>

<p>Building is automatic with "mvn package".</p>
