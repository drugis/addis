  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the efficacy and safety of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium in
      combination with two different corticosteroid (CS) regimes for the induction of remission of
      a lupus nephritis flare. Patients will be randomly allocated to standard CS regimen (group
      I) or to a reduced dose CS regimen (group II)

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A moderate to severe flare was defined as the occurrence of increased lupus activity after partial or complete remission, based on the presence of 1 BILAG A score or &gt;=3 BILAG B scores. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index divides lupus activity in 8 organs/systems which are each given a score of A to E. A=disease sufficiently active to need disease modifying treatment; B=problems requiring symptomatic treatment; C=mild stable disease; D=previously affected but currently inactive system; E=the system or organ has never been involved. BILAG score: A=9, B=3, C=1, D/E=0; range(0-72)</description>

    <description>Safety assessments included collecting all adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), with their severity and relationship to study drug. According to FDA 21CFR 314.80, a serious adverse event (SAE) is described as any adverse event that leads to death, is life threatening ( NIH criteria Grade 4), causes or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, or any other important medical event not described above.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>SLEDAI stands for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index and was a well established global score index based on assessment of 24 items measuring a disease activity in the 10-day period prior to the assessment. SLEDAI item weights range from 1 for fever to 8 for seizures. A maximum theoretical score is 105. Total score range from 1 to 105. A flare has been defined as a SLEDAI score increase of 3 or more to a level of 8 or higher. During flares SLEDAI scores of 25 to 30 are common.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to week 4, week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group) index divides lupus activity into 8 organs/systems and was based on the principle of the physician's intention to treat, assessing activity in the previous one month. Each organ or system was given a score of A to E, where A = disease that is sufficiently active to require disease modifying treatment; a B = problems requiring symptomatic treatment; C = stable mild disease; D = previously affected but currently inactive system; and E = the system or organ has never been involved. [A=9, B=3, C=1, D/E=0  the score range for each patient will be 0-72].</description>

        <description>A moderate to severe flare was defined as the occurrence of increased lupus activity after partial or complete remission, based on the presence of 1 BILAG A score or &gt;=3 BILAG B scores. British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) index divides lupus activity in 8 organs/systems which are each given a score of A to E. A=disease sufficiently active to need disease modifying treatment; B=problems requiring symptomatic treatment; C=mild stable disease; D=previously affected but currently inactive system; E=the system or organ has never been involved.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overall Disease Activity With Systematic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)</title>
        <description>SLEDAI stands for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index and was a well established global score index based on assessment of 24 items measuring a disease activity in the 10-day period prior to the assessment. SLEDAI item weights range from 1 for fever to 8 for seizures. A maximum theoretical score is 105. Total score range from 1 to 105. A flare has been defined as a SLEDAI score increase of 3 or more to a level of 8 or higher. During flares SLEDAI scores of 25 to 30 are common.</description>

Each organ or system was given a score of A to E, where A = disease that is sufficiently active to require disease modifying treatment; a B = problems requiring symptomatic treatment; C = stable mild disease; D = previously affected but currently inactive system; and E = the system or organ has never been involved. [A=9, B=3, C=1, D/E=0  the score range for each patient will be 0-72].</description>
